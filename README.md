# nlp_ai_webapp
Natural Language Processing Web App Project

This project follows the Microsoft Azure Learning Module: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/

For the back end, rather than creating a machine learning model, used a collection of AI services (known as Azure Cognitive Service). These services can either be accessed via an SDK or an HTTP call. We can use the Translator service to meet our primary goal of translating text.

For the front end, a Flask web application will be used to actually translate text as a user.
